    "(Sidebar: defining \"probability\" is interesting and contentious, and seems to distinguish disciplines from one another. According to [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Ch1_Introduction_PyMC3.ipynb#The-Bayesian-state-of-mind), probability, to a frequentist, represents the long-run frequency of an event given an increasing number of trials; to a Bayesian, on the other hand, probability is the \"believability\" in an event. Downey's definition is clearly **frequentist**, and it has a nice conciseness to it.)\n",
